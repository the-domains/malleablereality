In search of the orange shrimp
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f1c2a5a9-0609-4263-b58c-f88931606415.jpg)

Rumour
has it that there were once two brothers who didn't get along. Like most
siblings, Marco and Pedro would fight...a lot. In an attempt to stop the feuding,
their father would take them to the family restaurant after school and put them
to work. It was during these long summers that their father's love of food
finally rubbed off on them. And so, armed with a secret family recipe for orange
shrimp, they eventually opened up rival restaurants of their own somewhere
along the same stretch of beach. 

Or
so the story goes, depending on who tells it...

Here,
in the North-eastern tip of Brazil, you are spoilt for choice when it comes to
cuisine. I'm staying in Atins - 

a small,
remote fisherman's village on the border of Lençóis Maranhenses National Park. 

But
it's not just fresh fish that the area is famous for. Due to its constantly
moving sandbanks and flat water spots, it is kite-surfing heaven. The almost
perfect conditions attract hundreds of visitors a year from all over the world.
In spite of this, the area still manages to feel surprisingly unspoilt.

As
our 4x4 pulled up at the restaurant, the owner came out onto the sand to greet
us. Gabriela's smile was as warm as the balmy evening. 

Once
inside, she explained that the food would come when it's ready, for everyone to
share. Her motto: "In life, there's nothing more special than sharing a meal
and stories with each other". 

That
would explain the communal table, complete with wooden benches.

One
by one, the dishes arrived in colourful clay bowls that were placed down the
centre. 

Typical
to the region is a dish called Feijoada - a rich and smoky Brazilian Black Bean
stew accompanied with fluffy white rice. The flaky Sea Bass baked in salt and
zesty lime was also delicious and seemed to explode in my mouth. Moqueca
is also a favourite here in the Northeast. The slow roasted seafood stew
containing garlic, onions and peppers was packed full of flavour and left a
refreshing aftertaste of bright coriander. Just
as I was finishing off the last of my Cajuin (a refreshing non-alcoholic drink
made from Cashew fruit), the famous orange shrimp arrived. I thought about the
two brothers and the secret family recipe as I tucked in. Dripping with a
fragrant dressing made from orange and coconut, they were delicious, plump and
incredibly moreish -- everything I had hoped for. The
offer of Bolinhos de Chuva (sweet golden dumplings sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon) finished me off
and I was stuffed. Stepping
back out onto the white sand, I couldn't help but wonder what had caused the
brothers to fight and eventually go their separate ways. Was it over a girl?
Money? The secret family recipe? 

Just as I climbed back into the Jeep, I turned
to Gabriela and asked if she knew anything about the story that everyone was
talking about. She smiled."Well, I once heard a rumour about a man and
wife who would argue all the time..."
